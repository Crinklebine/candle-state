Candle State Pine Script for Tradingview

This script identifies the 4 different Candle States for use in #TheStrat.

Candle Up - The close of the current candle is greater than the close of the previous candle.
Candle Down - The close of the current candle is less than the close of the previous candle.

A Candle has only four fundamental states from a previous candle:

NOT Up OR NOT Down,
Up,
Down,
Up AND Candle Down

This can be optimized to simply displaying an UP or DOWN state on a display with the other two states being implied.

Though this script is extremely simple it is a teaching aid for #TheStrat.
The script also assists in the identification of up and down candles with gaps where the color of candle will not always match the Candle State.

Analysis of the candle types can help you define actionable signals and draw broadening formations.
